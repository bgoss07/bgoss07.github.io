<h2>About Me</h2>
<p> Data lends incredible insight into the way we function. It can help us provide positive, world-changing input that affects everything from estimating when a hospital is likely to run low on supplies to autonomous vehicles. This is why I have chosen to pursue a career in Data Analytics. 

Thus far, I've dealt mostly with Python and SQL. You'll see some results of a few projects I've done within the scope of learning the skills necessary to become a well-rounded data analyst, from web-scraping to custom visualizations. 

Thank you for your consideration.
